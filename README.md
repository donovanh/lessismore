Less Is More
==========

Less is more is currently a work in progress. It looks to:

 - consolidate Rich Clark's reset.css (itself an extension of Eric Meyer's reset.css) with Nicolas Gallagher's normalize.css
 - add a short, useful grid system (scaled to 1200px wide)
 - remove the need for frameworks with lots of stuff when very little stuff is required
